Master Control Program

This is a little project I dreamed up a few years ago, but never posted it
outside of my blog:

It uses threads, file datestamp checking, and DRb in an attempt at a pluggable
ruby based daemon with an interactive CLI interface.

It's a beginning. An idea. It begs to be used as a CLI framework of some sort.

Use it as you will. This is really just to make sure I don't lose it.
